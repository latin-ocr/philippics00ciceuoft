When, on the luth of March, the dictator Caesar
tell dead in the Hall of Pompeius at the foot of his
great rival's statue, the conspirator-s, brandishing
their bloody dagges-⁸ and calling on the name of
ciuem, passed out of the Sexum, preceded by a cap
of liberty fixed to the end of a spear.'1'hey pro·
claimed to all they met that they had slain a king
andatyrant. ln the meantime Μ. Antonius, Caesar's
eolleague in the consulship, whom Trebonius-—
Cicero says (Phil 214) by collusion—-had prevented
finan being present in the senate, escaped to his
house in the Carinae in the disguise of a slave.
The conspirators, being received in silence by the
audp‘fledpu popu lace, and being uncertain os the atti·
of Lepidus, Caesar's master of the horse, who
eanmunded alegion outside the walls, and of Caesar' s
veterana in the city, retreated ιο the Capitol to the
tection of a troop of gladiators whom D. Brutus
m hired on the pretence of games. The same
asternoon, or the next day, they descended to the
Forum and Brutus harangued the people. He was
respectiully but coldly received; but the praetor
Cinna,and Dolabella, who, in opposition to Antonius,
had so far attached himself to the popular cause,
by their intemperate references ιο Caesar roused the
populace to sury, and the erestsallen conspiratura
again returned to the Capitol. Towards nightsall
on the luth Cicero und other prominent meu visited
Brutus and his associates, and Cicero advised that
the two praetors, Brutus and Cassius, one consul
being dead, and the other, Antonius, having dis·
d, should summon the Senate to the Capitoline

emple for the following day, but he was overruled;
