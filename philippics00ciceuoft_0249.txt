Αἱ* the conclusion of the debete in the Senste on
the zoth· of December, Cicero proceeded to the
Formsnd there harengoed the people. He shewed
thui, though the term “'enemy had not been
mally applied to Antonius, yet that in effect he
baal been so describedz that the honours pand ω
Octavian, the action of the Martini end of the
Foorth legions, and the Semte' ι commendationis of
D. Brutos end the province of Gaul, by implicetion
declared Antonius to be ιιι enemy of the δαῖος
that the struggle with Antonius (with whom no
conditioni ’ἄροιτο were bie) was to decide
whether the Romans shond be rmitted to live
at ⁸11. And he urged them to ἱερὴ] the vslour
of their sorciathers which had mede the Romans the
conquerors of the world.

Spe-:king of this speech in his hat-angue to the
people in the sixth Philippic he ssidt

“Even if that day had been fatcd to be the
end of my life, on it 1 hed reaped sn abundent
harvest when yon an with one mind end voice
shonted that the State had been ι second time

, preserved by me.''

The genuineness os this speech has been, with
what can only be regarded ss eminess of scepticism,
impugned by Krause. But Κίος shows thet his
arguments, mostly a priori, ere singul-dy uncon·

’ vincing. These arguments ere based on ι passage
γ cited by Nonius which does not occur in the speech
