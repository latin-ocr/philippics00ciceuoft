1. We are consultui, Conscript fathers, on a
mu, but perhaps an imperative, μώμου the
oeuaul make· a mosten about the Appian Way and
the nint, the tribune about the Luperci. The
arrangement of auch matter· aeems an easy one,
yet the mind, being in auspeme bemuoe os greater
earet, wanden frum the question in delate. For
&binga bavo been brought, conscript Fathers, into
the greatest pern, and almost into an extreme crisis.
lt b not without cause that 1 have always sured,
and never approved, that aending of the envoys.
what their return ia likely to bring ua 1 do not
know but who doe· not see tha) a supineneu 0¹
meod the waiting for them induces? Fur there
{a no holding back among those who lament that,
in the hope of recovering ita ancient authority,
the Senate ia renewing its youth, that the Roman
people h in alliance with this our order, that Italy
cooperate, that our armies are prepared, and our
commandera ready. Even now they invent replies
from Antonius, and defend them. Some allege that
he demanda the diemissa! of all armies. Of a surety
we bave aeut envoys to him, not that he should
οδε] and give ear to the commanda of this body,
but thathe should offer terms, impone lawe, and
bid ua throw Italy open to foreign natium! and
that too while he is himself ease, from whom greater
danger ia ‘to be dreaded than from any natione.
